# Multi-Agent Framework Architecture

## Overview
T-Developer's multi-agent framework is built on three core technologies:
- **Agno Framework**: Ultra-fast agent instantiation (3μs)
- **AWS Agent Squad**: Open-source orchestration
- **Bedrock AgentCore**: Enterprise runtime

## Agent Communication
- Event-driven messaging
- Asynchronous task delegation
- State synchronization
- Error propagation

## Performance Characteristics
- Agent instantiation: ~3μs
- Memory per agent: 6.5KB
- Concurrent agents: 10,000+
- Session duration: 8 hours max

## Integration Patterns
- SupervisorAgent coordination
- Parallel execution
- Dependency resolution
- Result aggregation
