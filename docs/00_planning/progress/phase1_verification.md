## 🔄 Integration Testing

### Full Workflow Demo ✅

Successfully demonstrated complete self-evolution cycle:

```
Research (7 files) → Plan (4 tasks) → Refactor (changes) → Evaluate (metrics)
```

### Data Flow Verification ✅

- Research → Planner: Research data successfully passed
- Planner → Refactor: Tasks from plan executed
- Refactor → Evaluator: Changes evaluated
- Evaluator → Research: Metrics inform next cycle
