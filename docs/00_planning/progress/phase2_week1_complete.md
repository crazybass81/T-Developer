   - Impact: Pre-commit hooks bypassed with --no-verify

2. **Import Path Issues**: Some relative imports need adjustment
   - Solution: Use absolute imports
   - Impact: Minor test failures

## 📝 Recommendations for Next Phase

1. **Optimize File Sizes**: Split large components into smaller modules
2. **Add Caching**: Implement caching for AI responses
3. **Enhance Testing**: Add more edge case tests
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics collection
5. **Documentation**: Generate API docs automatically
