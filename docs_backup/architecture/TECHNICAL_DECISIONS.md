- Loose coupling (Events)
- Debuggability
- Scalability

#### Decision

Start with **DAG-based orchestration**, evolve to **event-driven** for specific workflows.

#### Rationale

- **DAG First**: Easier to reason about, debug
- **Events Later**: Add where loose coupling needed
- **Hybrid**: Best of both worlds
- **Migration Path**: Can evolve gradually

#### Implementation

```python
# Phase 1: DAG
dag = {
    "research": ["plan"],
    "plan": ["code"],
    "code": ["evaluate"]
}

# Phase 2: Events for extensions
events = {
    "code.complete": ["security.scan", "test.generate"],
    "security.issue": ["security.fix"]
}
```
